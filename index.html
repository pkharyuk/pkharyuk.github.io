<p>Good day! My name is Pavel, and this is my personal page.</p>
<p></p>
<p>About me: research intern at Sk, specialist in Applied Mathematics and Computer Sciences, ph.d. of Physico-Mathematical Sciences.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Interests: Learning something new and extending learned knowledge, in Mathematics, Physics,
Biology, Chemistry, Medicine, Neuroscience, Computer Science. Preferred activity is
one that requires concentration, meditativeness and individual performance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Beware: I am not tolerant to a number of unhealthy phenomenas that ruins the natural norms and rules. To name a few: "non-traditional" relations, democratic and liberal values, totalitarian order, any kind of blasphemy against God (the Higher Forces), any manipulating things, lived out and degradated traditonal forms.</p>
